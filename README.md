# The Ending Phase of July                                    
With the end of this July coming to the past, the progress of my research project cooperating with a Trinidad company ,             
I need to add some regular variables to my life, though some painful but inevitable expectations would challenge my trials in the very beginning.                       

          
I believe each of us has experienced those feelings of boredom kind of deep into blood and your stomach.           
People always insist on some conventional wisdoms even they make no sense in many cases. One simple algabric conclusion held by the crowd is that if one guy get up one hour earlier each day, with one month's passing he/she would obtain the extra time of more than one day as payoff. But people may ignore some facts like if I sleep one-hour longer, maybe I can finish the daily assignments more efficient with the 3-hour working 工作量 finished in one hour. It seems that people often underestimate the value of relaxing.                 
 
            
I changed my mind staying in London, and decided a more than one hour's train taking me back to Swindon to spend my christmas holidays with my relatives.                        


Yours,
