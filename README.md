# Supply Chain Case Study_Meditech Surgical                                      
When studying a case in supply chain management, the well-informed pattern can be shown as:          
**'Products'**                              
- Basic products composition/features (vital components, manufacturing period, mainstream models, etc)               
- BOM (Bill of Materials), Relations (Parent-Son items, Substitution Relation) with different items in the BOM                

**'Organizations/People'**               
- Vendors collaboraton (procurement)                
- Planners synchronization (completeness of manufacturing materials)                 
- Contract coordinators adjustments (front-line interaction with clients)                  

**'Business Thinking'**              
- Pain Points, Emergency Reaction, Planning/Management Strategies           
- Integrated Product Development and Lifecycle Management of Products             
- The Entire Industry Development and Ecology                
                               
As you know, I prefer the flexibility against boilerplate. So I am always keen to read some new cases that grew in a different pattern.The first case in the list is the story on Meditech Surgical, with more details shown in the book _Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts, Strategies and Case Studies_ written by David Simchi-Levi, Philip Kaminsky and Edith Simchi-Levi.             
                       
By the way, besides my business interest especially in digital supply chain management and analysis, my website, which is the sharing space for self-expressing and self-interation.            

Yours,
