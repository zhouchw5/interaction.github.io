# Supply Chain Case Study_Meditech Surgical                                      
When studying a case in supply chain management, the well-informed pattern can be shown as:          
**'Products'**                              
- Basic products composition/features (vital components, manufacturing period, mainstream models, etc)               
- BOM (Bill of Materials), Relations (Parent-Son items, Substitution Relation) with different items in the BOM                

**'Organizations/People'**               
- Vendors collaboraton (procurement)                
- Planners synchronization (completeness of manufacturing materials)                 
- Contract coordinators adjustments (front-line interaction with clients)                  

**'Business Thinking'**              
- Pain Points, Emergency Reaction, Planning/Management Strategies           
- Integrated Product Development and Lifecycle Management of Products             
- The Entire Industry Development and Ecology                
                               
As you know, I prefer the flexibility against boilerplate. So I am always keen to read some new cases that grew in a different pattern.The first case in the list is the story on Meditech Surgical, with more details shown in the book _Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts, Strategies and Case Studies_ written by David Simchi-Levi, Philip Kaminsky and Edith Simchi-Levi.             
                       
By the way, besides my business interest especially in digital supply chain management and analysis, the reason why I kindle my interest in analysing or just simply narrating some supply chain cases is that I tend to exploit more scenes used for self-expressing, as what I have done in this website, which is the sharing space for self-expressing and self-interation. But case study would be not merely limited in individual exploration, but also the foundation for building up business sense and systematic thingking. Like the level of the modernization in supply chain is one of the most important indicators assessing whether an industry chain has evolved to a mature class, I always believe that exploration in supply chain analysis and management would be the critical clew dragging the whole business knowledge network.
